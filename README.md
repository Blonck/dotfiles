dotfiles

# My personal dotfiles ( No there are no passwords saved in these files! )

This is a collection of my personal config files for:

* zsh
* vim
* awesome
* Xresources
* xscreensaver
* clang-format

I also added the binary of [btsync]("https://www.bittorrent.com.com/intl/de/sync"
"BitTorrent Sync Application" ). This is just for convenience, because 
I use btsync on all my machines to sync some folders.
